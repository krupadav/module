# module:
Module: is a collection different members,any python file is a module. It has variables, class, function, method and so many thingsWhatever is there in python, can be added into a module
We have 2 types: 1)Built-in modules: present in python itself. Example: math,csv, sys, os, array,itertools, collection,statistics..
to check built-in modules we use help('modules') it will display all modules from default python location 2)User defined modules: created as per user requirement- This must be present within the same python project.
__pycache__: when we import any module from a perticular directory then its .pyc file gets created and stored in this folder
.pyc get created to convert .py to bytecode/machine code.
